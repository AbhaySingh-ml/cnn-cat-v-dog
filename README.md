# 🐶🐱 CNN Cat vs Dog Classification

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model built to classify images of **cats and dogs**.  
It is a foundational deep learning project aimed at understanding **image classification**, **data preprocessing**, and **model evaluation** using **TensorFlow/Keras**.

---

## 🚀 Objective
The goal is to train a neural network that can accurately predict whether an image contains a **cat** or a **dog**.

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Implementation of **CNNs for image classification**
- Image preprocessing and augmentation techniques
- Application of **Keras Sequential API**
- Performance evaluation using **accuracy**, **loss**, and **confusion matrix**
- Saving and loading trained models (`.h5` format)
